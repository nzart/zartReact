            <p>I graduated from Clemson with a Bachelor of Science in Graphic Communications. I tailored my curriculum towards web design and development. I have learned to love both of the creative and technical sides of all things front end.</p>

            <p>My primary focus is on UI design but I have helped with branding projects as well. I enjoy being able to speak with business owners and helping their vision come to life.</p>

            <p>If I'm not designing or developing I am most likely running or having a nice cup of coffee. I geniunely love helping people and I aim to have a servant heart every day. I would love to help you with or project or be a part of your team.</p>

            <p>Dream big, work your ass off.</p>
