I was approached and asked if I could help with a logo and brand direction. The idea behind the business was a faith-based coaching program with a portion of the profits going towards churches. The logo needed to be unisex, bold, Temple was to be in all caps, and incorporate negative space." />

          <Textandhead head="First Draft" para="I instantly had three separate ideas; one was Greek inspired, the second was minimal and sans-serif, and the third was using motion. For the badge I pictured something that was distinct but simple. I had to take in to account it would be printed so I did not want too many small details." />

          <Textandhead head="Iterations" para="The coach chose the one in the middle. She had asked if there was a way to incorporate a barbell in to the design. I began to look at the whitespace in between the letters of Temple. I noticed that the M and P lined up to look like a bar. I added two blocks to act like the weights. " />
